# Walmart-Hackathon-
This a repository created by Team 16 -Sejal Palde, Manasi Giri, Gargi Saraf. We have created a Credit Card Fraud Detection System using Machine Learning for Walmart Hackathon.
There are various frauds among them credit card fraud is a critical form of fraud that directly impacts individuals and businesses, leading to significant financial losses, compromised personal information, and potential damage to credit scores. Prompt detection and prevention of credit card fraud are vital to maintain trust in financial systems and safeguard customers. To achieve this, credit card fraud detection employs powerful machine learning algorithms like Gradient Boosting and Isolation Forest. Gradient Boosting learns from historical transaction data to identify fraudulent patterns, while Isolation Forest efficiently detects anomalies in unsupervised data. By combining their strengths through ensembling, the fraud detection system becomes more robust, minimizing false positives and negatives, and effectively flagging and denying fraudulent transactions. This comprehensive approach ensures secure transactions and protects both customers and businesses from potential financial harm.
